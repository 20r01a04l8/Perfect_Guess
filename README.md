# Perfect_Guess
These are my latest projects created in 2022.
The basic understanding for this code is:
Step 1:  Import random for your python File\n.
step 2: Then ask the computer to take a random value (By using randint).
step 3: Give a Range to the computer (1-100) to make it user friendly and not to make it complex to guess.
step 4: Initialize the number . Here I used attempt =  1
step 5: Lest's dive into the if-else structure.
First If: 
        if we have given an input to the file is 25 and it is greater than the winning number then it prints you
        The Number is bigger than the number! Try again: 
        and also the attempt becomes   +1
Second condition(elif):
        if we have given an input to the file is 100 and it is smaller than the winning number then it prints you
        The Number is smaller than the number! Try again: 
        and also the attempt becomes   +1
 
 
Third conditionn(else):
        if your answer is right then it prints out
        print(f"YAY! You guessed it right in {attempt} attempts")
        YAY! You guessed it right in {attempt} attempts
        here it shows you how many attempts you have took to guess the number
        and finally put a break to close the loop.
